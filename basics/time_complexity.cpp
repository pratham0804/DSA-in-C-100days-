// What is timecomplexity?
// Ans.: incorrect ans : Time taken by the code to execute 
// As with the use of different system with different versions of configutation , a significantt 
// differnce can be observed in the time taken
// ex, old machine and new macbook


// Correct answer is RAte at which time taken by code increases with respect to the input size.


// time complexity is not computed in seconds .
// big oh notations comes in picture

// Time complexity is to be computed in terms of worst case scenario
// Avoid constants


// for( int i=0 ; i<= n ; i++){

    // defination .

// }

// time complexity is big oh of 3n.
// loop runs n times and 3 is (condition check + increment + defination ) 
// no declaration added.





// SPACE COMPLEXITY :- Auxilary space + input space 
// Auxilary space :- the space used to solve the problem 
// input space :- the space used to store the input values 


// for  example :- a, b       and c = a+b
// a and b takes input space and c takes Auxilary space .

// never do any thing on the input 
// never ever manipulate data , like b = a+b 
// take some extra space , variables and store in it but not to manipulate the data 
// answer the interviewer , i do not want to tamper the data , so i am using extra variable in order to solve the problem
// agar interviewer bolta hai ki do  it in within the same input variables , then do it .



// in coding rounds , 1s = 10 to the power 8 operations .
